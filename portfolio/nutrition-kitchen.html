     <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h4>Scope</h4></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><p>Develop a product or system solution to fill the educational gaps in Troy's <a href="http://www.arkcharter.org/">Ark Community Charter School</a>'s 6<sup>th</sup> Grade Students' curriculum and learned knowledge.</p></div>
        </div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h4>User Research</h4></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><p>Preliminary user research was conducted through two main methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interviews with faculty, staff, and students at Ark Community Charter School</li>
            <li>In-class observation of class periods</li>
    </ul></div>
      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><h5>Interviews</h5>
            <p>The most important finding was that not many student had proper educational support at home to aid them in learning the core curriculum. For this reason, most time in class was spent on teaching the core curriculum in the depth necessary for students to understand the material. This left little time to teach other subjects or core compentencies to the curriculum.</p>
                <p>It many life learnings that were considered 'common-knowledge' or many people take for granteds were not as common as many of us assumed. This led to many gaps in students' personal growth in areas such as fitness, nutrition, creativity, esteem, and more.</p>
                </div>
                  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><h5>In-Class Observation</h5>
            <p>In class observation was conducted to understand how the current classes at the Ark Charter School organized and what teaching methods were employed.</p> 
                <p>From in class observation it was seen that many students were furnished with a computer during the school day and encouraged to use it at certain points in the class in order to growth their digital literacy. It was also seen that it was difficult to keep students attention for long periods of time if they were not all actively enaged.

            <h4>Narrowing Focus</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
            <p>The insights from both methods of research propelled the design and development process. Based on these findings, it was determined that there was a great opportunity to impact students' nutritional understanding and choices. In order to make sure this was the right decision, interviews were conducted with the students to gauge their current understanding of their meals and nutrition overall.</p>
        <p>From these interviews, it was found that this was a great opportunity gap and should be pursued.</p>
        <p>It was chosen to focus on a software solution as it would enable all students to be engaged on a one-to-one basis and support the school's digital literacy effort.</p></div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h4>Co-Design Actvity</h4></div>
         <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><img src="../images/nutrition-kitchen/paper-prototype.jpg" class="port-pic"></div>
       <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><p>It was very important to us to develop meals that were familiar Ark Community Charter's 6<sup>th</sup> grade students in order to provide them with a platform which resonated with their daily lives. By enabling students to contextual the information gained from Nutrition Kitchen into real knowledge, students were able to apply the knowledge learned in their own decision making.</p>
           <p>A Co-Design Activity was used to uncover this data. Students were given ingredients and asked to make different meals. Students were able to use a card as many times as desired and even make their own when they felt an important ingredient was missing. These meals, along with other healthy counterparts, were import to add to Nutrition Kitchen's library of recipes to teach students about their current meal choices and healthy alternatives.</p></div>

            <h4>Design and Development</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>Based on initial interviews, observation, and co-design activities, a preliminary software was developed to user test for further insights. In order to best understand if we were meeting our user needs, software was tested with students early and often.</p>
                <p>The initial software iteration of Nutrition Kitchen was developed with MIT's Scratch software, for ease of development, with the visual assets being developed through Adobe Illustrator.</p>
                <p>The software prompted students to make meals and outputted the nutritional facts for each meal after it was completed.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><p>From the first iteration of Nutrition Kitchen, it was found that students loved making meals but had difficulty developing meals on their own. Additionally, it was found that students needed more informational about nutritional facts about their food options - both before and after making decisions on what to digitally consume.</p>
            <p>In order to add complexity to the game, a full day model was developed in order to allow students to make three meals and two snacks - enabling students to balance their nutritional choices throughout the day and on more facets than just calorie count.</p>
                <p>Once again, paper prototyping was utilized again in order to understand user needs that weren't enabled in the software and in order to engage all students during each session. </p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                <p>After the initial round of user testing, the software was moved into Adobe Flash for development. From here an informational screen, educational materials, and further complexity were added to the game.</p> 
                <p>The information screen taught students how to use the software and pointed them to educational materials before and during use throughout the game. Educational materials included information about both meals and ingredients. Finally, further complexity was added through the all day meal planning (3 meals, 2 snacks) features and by adding additional meal options and more descriptive images as necessary.</p>
                <p>In order to gauge the impact of software on student's understanding of nutrition, a pre- and post-software-use quiz was implemented. Students were prompted to take the quiz a day before using the software and then an hour after completing a session with the software. While it would have been optimal to have had a longer period of time between software use and testing - due do time and access constraints this was the only possibility. Despite this, there was an overall improvement in test scores between the pre- and post-quizzes indicating some gained value.</p>

                <p>While Nutrition Kitchen provided value for the Ark Community Charter School, much more value could have been provided through more robust software capabilities.Had the project been able to continue, a more dedicated software lead would have been necessary.</p>
                <p>Additionally, more user research and testing would be integral in understanding what features students found most beneficial and what features should be added or removed.</p>
