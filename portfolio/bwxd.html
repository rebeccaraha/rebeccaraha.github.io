                    <p>Better World by Design is a student-led conference organized and facilitated by Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design. The conference is an interdisciplinary event which aims to <a href="http://betterworldxdesign.com/about.html#mission">envision a world where design-thinking is accessible to everyone in order to catalyze positive change on a local and global scale'</a>.</p>
                    <p>I have been lucky enough to attend the conference multiple times, participate in workshops, learn from panels and presentations with subject-matter experts, and network with peers and industry leaders.</p>

                        <p>At the 2013 Better World by Design, I had the opportunity to participate in a workshop unlike any other design thinking activity I had done before.</p>
                        <p>The Honey Badgers, Flash Floods, and Mustard Gas, led by Ryan Clifford an Associate Director of Center for Design Practice at Maryland Institute College of Art, essentially forced participants to think incorrectly. Clifford asserted, “Humans have the capacity for developing ingenious solutions to these challenges. How do you unlock the ingenuity that exists within people and organizations by thinking wrong?”</p>
                        <p>He channeled this mission to misleading a room of fifty design thinkers into creating the worst ideas possible. He then forced these teams to turn these seemingly terrible ideas into advertising methods for a brand of his choice. </p>
                        <p>While I don’t remember the exact details of this activity, what it did teach me was to embrace ideas that make you think - whether they are good, bad, or somewhere in between. We often dismiss ideas because we don’t think they’re a good idea, but when we are able to find value in these ideas as stepping stones - as opposed to final solutions - they will enable us to develop solutions that are truly groundbreaking.</p>
