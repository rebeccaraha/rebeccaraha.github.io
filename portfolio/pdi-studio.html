        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>The Design, Innovation, &amp; Society Studio (commonly called the Product Design &amp; Innovation Studio) has been through a state of flux throughout the last two years. With increased dedicated space and new materials being allocated to the Design, Innovation, &amp; Society (DIS) Program, the culture of the program has shifted. The PDI Studio: Revitalized project took a critical look at the past and current culture in order to create impactful change guided by Organizational Culture and Workspace Culture methodology.</p>

            <h4>Defining the Problem</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>Throughout the past four years, the Design, Innovation, and Society program has grown and adapted more deeply and vastly than ever before. The program has seen the emergence of a new Dean, the leave of a supplementary advisor, the loss of a key professor, the addition of new space, and the adoption of new tools and materials – and that is just scratching the surface. These growth and adaptations have altered the physical Design, Innovation, and Society Space, and in turn altered the respective community and culture of those who inhabit the space.</p>
            <p>While many and most of these strides have been positive, some of the cultural changes incurred have not been to the program’s benefit. Increased space has moved students and all prototyping supplies out of the original Studio Space and into a new Auxiliary space. This migration of students and materials has led the Studio to lose the life it once had and become less of a living breathing space. The lack of prototyping supplies leave the Studio as a stark lifeless room, and the migration of students has led to less-cross year communication.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><p>The most integral part of the Studio Revitalization project was understanding user constraints and social theory to inform decision making during the design and development project. While user research, academic literature research, and student engagement were extensive, this information has been distilled to the necessary key points.</p></div>

            <h5>Constraints</h5>
        <p>A number of constraints bind Rensselaer, the DIS program, and the respective projects that can be done to improve the DIS program and PDI space. Past obvious constraints – ensuring all changes and improvements are legal, etc. – there are a number of additional constraints imposed on potential improvements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Walls cannot be moved, painted, or physically/structurally altered. </li>
                <li>Dedicated space cannot be undedicated.</li>
                <li>Improvements cannot be costly – short term or long term.</li>
                <li>Manpower within the DIS program is limited. </li>
                <li>The design of these changes must compliment the space.</li> 
                <li>Changes must be easily movable.</li>
                <li>Improvements must be sustainable (and therefore, reusable).</li>
                <li>Collaborative tools must be plentiful enough that multiple student groups can capitalize on them without infringing upon one another’s ability to collaborate.</li>
                <li>Collaborative tools must be easily accessible and storable.</li>

            <h5>Shein’s Model of Organizational Culture &amp; Elsbach and Bechky’s Categories of Workspace Improvement</h5>
<p>The Schein Model of Organizational Culture dissects and inspects what makes, augments, and grows organizational culture from a number of angles. Schein’s extensive research takes these corporate characteristics and potential change catalysts into three master groups:</p>
            <p><span class="bold"><span class="bodyunder">Physical and Social Context:</span></span> Artifacts or Explicit Communication</p>
            <p><span class="bold"><span class="bodyunder">Espoused Values</span></span> or Official Values</p>
            <p><span class="bold"><span class="bodyunder">Basic Assumptions:</span></span> How Individuals Perceive the Organization or Core Principles Underlying World Views<sup>1</sup></p>
            <p>The most sensible subset of Schein’s Model to explore in order to enact meaningful organizational change is the Physical and Social Context level. By effecting things can that be physically touched, seen, and interacted with, the best chance to affect a cultural change is achieved. When looking at tangible options to improve the Studio Space and in turn, the PDI culture, the best model to turn to is Kimberly Elsbach and Beth Bechky’s categories of workspace improvement. Elsbach and Bechky break down these improvements into three main types; Instrumental Symbolic, and Aesthetic,2 which can best be translated to; Functional, Creative or Collaborative, and Inspiring. These areas were my inspiration moving forward.</p>
            <p>As Functional and Collaborative improvements were underway under the guidance of Dean of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, I chose to work within the Inspirational  Improvement area. This provided me with the unique opportunity to create the first piece of art that would live in the studio space.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><h5>Final Inspirational Improvements</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>When determining the proper aesthetic improvement necessary to enact the desired cultural change in the studio space, a number of immediate needs emerged. First and foremost, the need to break the room’s ubiquitous grey tone. Secondly, the need to ensure that the manifestation and implementation of the aesthetic change was in line with DIS student’s interests, values, and understanding of the DIS program – something that students truly felt a connection with, that Professors felt was in line with the DIS program’s goals and mission, and that prospective students would be interested in. Finally, that the aesthetic improvement was in fact aesthetically pleasing – in design and placement – as to not be distracting, but a presence felt in the room. While the first and third needs were undoubtedly easy to fulfill, the second need required the most attention to ensure it was properly met and executed.</p>
            <p>The numerous surveys conducted with DIS students, however, made the choice clearer than one would expect however. The most prominent trends from these interviews and surveys were Burt Swersey’s - a late professor’s - impact on DIS students experience as students and the overarching mission of the DIS program to “Make Great Stuff &amp; Do No Evil”. As these two themes prevailed, it was obvious that an inspirational centerpiece in the Studio would have to reflect them both.</p>
            <p>Burt Swersey was known for his Swersey-isms, or common sayings. Burt constantly reminded students of the importance of the need to design for a better world, to be socially conscious, to do good – and these reminders came out in a number of trademark quotes:</p>
        <ul><li>Start With What Exists - Make It Better</li>
        <li>Don’t Ask Permission</li>
        <li>Not If, How?</li>
        <li>Don’t Do Nonsense</li>
        <li>See Opportunities Everywhere</li>
        <li>People Over Profit</li>
        <li>Challenge your Assumptions</li>
    </ul>
<p>These trademark Swersey-isms, and many others, informed many PDIer’s experiences within the program and with Burt as professor – yet one rings more loud and true than any of the others. Burt’s greatest Swersey-ism, “Don’t Do Nonsense”. </p>
<p>“Don’t Do Nonsense” speaks volumes about the DIS Program – as it is placed within a Science and Technology Studies program – a program which values informed decision making and proper planning. The quote reaches deep into students’ experiences and values, as we all aim to great something meaningful, something impactful. At its core, “Don’t Do Nonsense” is DIS. The final design was created to be hung in the back of the PDI studio, on the west facing wall. The project is still underway and final plaque will be laser cut and hung above the back doors of the studio. The project is being sponsored by leftover funds from a sunsetted DIS student indicative, the Re:Design Scholarship.</p>
