            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                <p>As an academic Design-Engineering hybrid, I've always been interested in the dynamic between Designers &amp; Engineers - both those who study and practice the two disciplines independently, as well as those, who conduct them in tandem.</p>
                <p>The research presented below began as an exploration of Designers + Engineers, which pivoted into a much different area of exploration. The initial objective of this research was as follows: to understand how engineers, designers, and engineer-design hybrids perceive one-another in the terms of each others' charactertistics and in the context of their work.</p>

                     <li><b>Diary/Journal Entry</b> - Write a journal entry as if you were your doll. What did you do at work that day? How did you feel about it?

                 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12"><p>The methods presented, while highly targetted in their exectuion could be easily adapted to meet a number of research needs based on the population and research area.</p>
                     <h5>Design a Doll, Design a Desk/Workstation, and Diary/Journal Entry</h5>
                     <p>The first set of methods (Design a Doll, Design a Desk/Workstation, and the Diary/Journal Entry) provide the necessary tools for participants to express their characteristic feelings about other groups in the context of work.</p>
                     <h6>Environment-Based Adaptation</h6>
                     <p>This method could be adapted to change the context (i.e.: to change from work to school, one could change the second activity from a desk to a locker).</p>
                     <h6>Before-and-After</h6>
                     <p>It also shows promise as a 'before-and-after' tool to aid users in confronting their mental models or biases. This could be achieved by having participants create a mental model of a person or group of people before meeting them and then once again after spending an amount of time with them. </p>
                     <p>The first set of activities could be compared with the second to uncover areas where users biases were challenged or changed and so on.</p>
                     <h6>Participant-Demographic Adaptation</h6>
                     <p>Last, but not least, these activities could be utilized with different participants who aren't as easily able to express their thoughts or feelings - such as children. It allows those who would not be able to articulate their mental models to express them in a non-verbal way.</p>
                     <p>In other cases, it would provide those who are unable to express their mental models through other traditional means to bring them to life, or even possibly discover mental models that they did not know they had, by personifying them. </p>
                     <h5>A Day in the Life: Children's Book</h5>
                     <p>Where the first set of activities focuses more on perception of characteristics and a shallow understanding of work resposibilities and attitudes, the second acivity (A Day in the Life: Children's Book) explores these work responsibilities and attitudes much deeper.</p>
                     <p>This activity is not without discomfort though. Many participants met the activity with apprehension as they felt that that deep knowledge wasnecessary to complete the activity. This was mitigated by instructing users to be creative, while realistic, about what they thought the subject truly did. They were encouraged to fill in assumptions where they were unsure and to provide as much detail or information they feel a children's' book would have.</p>
                     <p>This study is therefore much more suited for a finite research topic - as opposed to a high level overview or understanding. This activity could therefore be applied to a number of contexts including, but not limited to, some of the following:</p>
                     <ul>
                     <li>Understanding how students spend their time and possible stressors they have</li>
                     <li>How visitors interact with a new city</li>
                    <li>Decision-making processes for buying a car, a house, or other activity-intensive decisions</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p></p>
