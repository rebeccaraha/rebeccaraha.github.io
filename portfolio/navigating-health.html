            </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
            <p>To understand why insured young adults who are newly independent (either graduate students or young professionals) and have insurance and access to health services choose not to go to the doctor as often as recommended or necessary.</p>

                <h4>Interviews</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>Seven interviews were conducted with young adults in varying locations around the country and genders to provide a diverse set of viewpoints about health care services. These interviews were used a starting point in order to decide what human-centered research tools should be employed next.</p>
                <h5>Key Findings</h5>
                <ul>
                <li>Routine and reminders are important when it comes to regular healthcare.</li>
                    <li>Males decreased perceived need to see a multitude of health professionals (no OB/GYN or birth control prescriptions necessary, less social pressure to see a dermatologist) leads them to receive less healthcare overall as they are not used to regularly seeing any health practitioner.</li>
                    <li>Users with doctors within their families receive more regular but fragmented care.</li>
                    <li>Users are more often deterred by using health services when receiving good news than bad news.</li>
                    <li>Users feel that a lot of time is wasted going to see health professionals because they’re not going to uncover any new data.</li>
                    <li>Users relate “feeling health” to being healthy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Literature Review</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>A literature review was chosen a supplemental method for understanding why people do not receive proper medical care when they have access to it. This method was chosen as to illuminate additional areas to focus human-centered activities and research on. </p>
                <p>Taber, Leyva, and Persokie’s publication “Why Do People Avoid Medical Care? A Qualitative Study Using National Data” was reviewed.</p>
            
                      <h5>Key Findings</h5>
                <ul>
                <li>Most insights from Taber, Leyva, and Persokie’s study were consistent with the qualitative research conducted thus far.</li>
                    <li>One outlier, that contradicted all information however, was that people avoid medical care due to unfavorable Physician experiences - when asked about this, most users noted they would just change health care providers.</li>
                </ul>
                      </div>
        </div>
         <div class="borderline"></div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                <h4>Stakeholder Map</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>A stakeholder map was developed to understand the major players in Health Services. Stakeholders which users commonly interface with have been circled to understand which stakeholders effect user’s experiences and therefore what interactions in their journey they are likely to change or color their perception of Health Services and long term decision making.</p>
                <h5>Key Findings</h5>
                <ul><li>
                Better understanding of areas where the largest, noticeable improvement can be made in terms of patient experience. (Not to discredit systematic change at a higher level.)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Cultural Probe</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>A cultural probe was conducted on users to understand their perception and experiences while navigating throughout the Health Services system. Users where given a set of photos and asked to go through each and describe how each piece of the process makes them feel. This activity was conducted to get more in-depth information about pain points as opposed to just describing the entire experience as “annoying”, “a waste of time”, etc.</p>
                <h5>Key Findings</h5>
                <ul>
                <li>Users feel a lot of time is wasted and work is duplicated throughout the medical process.</li>
                <li>Users use online resources - such as WebMD - to look up ailments even though they know they’re unreliable and they shouldn’t.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

                <h4>Co-Design</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>Two Co-Design activities were conducted to understand users current and desired General Physician experiences. These activities enabled users to speak of their last (typical) General Physician’s visit and discuss pain points, as well as create their ideal doctor’s office.</p>
                <h5>Key Findings</h5>
                <ul>
                <li>Users waiting room experiences last longer than most General Physician visits and the waiting room experience is a major pain point.</li>
                    <li>Users prefer offices that are more personable and have doctor’s own person artifacts within them.</li>
                    <li>Users prefer phone interactions with Physician staff - as opposed to digital communication - due to the current state of health communication software.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
                      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>During the period of this project, the opportunity to do a case study was presented.</p>
                <h7>Demographic Information</h7>
                <ul>
                <li>Female</li>
                <li>Mid-20s</li>
                <li>Recently Relocated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</li></ul>
            <h5>Key Findings</h5>
                <ul>
                <li>Insurance companies do not have enough information easily accessible to their customers - leading to wasted time for both customers and corporations.</li>
                    <li>Procrastination can lead to not being able to see a Physician when necessary due to other roadblocks.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <h5>Final Insights</h5>
                <ul>
                <li>Males and Females must be treated differently throughout the health care services process on the administrative end to ensure they are properly capitalizing on the necessary services available to them.</li>
<li>The time users spend waiting could be better capitalized on to enable them to feel that their time is being properly utilized when navigating health services.</li>
<li>Most users do not go to the doctor until something is unbearably painful or physically obvious/bothersome.</li>
<li>Users’ procrastination and administrative health service barriers make it unduly difficult to see Physicians in a timely manner. Health services are not timely, yet users procrastinate.
</li>
                </ul></div>
                      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                <h5>Product Opportunities</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved Data Information Systems to avoid duplication of information and access to medical records.</li>
                    <li>Better waiting time usage - such as provided space to work, more social seating areas, etc.</li>
                    <li>Embedding the doctor into other necessary experiences. (For instance, having doctor’s on staff for large corporate campuses enabling users to leave work for minimal time to see a doctor and incentivizing other patients to be on time and leave on time to make their work-day appointments. - Similar to how Etsy has yoga in their office building.)</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Guiding Design Principle</h5>
                <p>Male and Female medical services should not and cannot be managed the same way due to different biological and habitual needs.</p>
