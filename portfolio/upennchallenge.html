        <p>This past October, the University of Pennsylvania's Integrated Product Design program facilated a 24-gour Design Challenge for students from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northwestern University, Carnegie Mellon University, and their own university.</p>
             <p>Students from Integrated Design programs from each university were selected to participate in the challenge in Philadephia - which was sponsored in conjunction with Penn Medicine- and given resources to subject matter experts, stakeholders, and facilities to explore the problem statement and develop solutions.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
            <p>Eldery patients commonly suffer from Postoperative Cognitive Decline (POCD) or Delirium, a threatening cognitive issue, after waking up from post-surgery anesthesia. This disorder can excite hysteria and lead to long-term cognitive decline for these eldery patients if not properly managed and mitigated. Develop a solution to improve the current state of POCD management and aid its respective stakeholders.</p>

             <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
             <p>The challenge kicked off with a Penn Medicine subject-matter expert presenting the POCD problem. After her initial presentation, participants were given access to materials to explore and understand POCD. </p>
             <p>Content was divided between team members, in order to enable the most information consumption in the time allotted. </p></div>

             <p>Following intial problem statement research, the team began to research with stakeholders.</p>
                 <p>By speaking with people effected by POCD, both primarily and secondarily, the team was able to to understand the core experiences and emotions felt throughout this process. </p>
                 <p>After these interviews, these experiences and emotions were categorized and synthesized for better understanding.</p>

            <p>In order to better understand the biological aspects, hospital constriants, and caretaker perspective, team members conducted a two hour field site visit.</p>
            <p>The field visit enabled team members to interview physicians and other medical pracitioners to understand their pain points in the context of thier envrionment. These interviews enabled the practioners to use their environment to thoroughly explain the problem and while providing fodder for the team to ask questions.</p>

             <p>The team brainstormed ideas for a number of key areas ripe for intervention and innovation.</p>
                 <p>The ideation was purposely unbounded un order to enable users to explore design solutions for all key stakeholders. These ideas were developed through rapid rounds of ideation and then categorized for discussion.</p>
                 <p>From here, three ideas were chosen to be primarily paper prototyped and presented to key stakeholders and subject-matter experts for rapid feedback and iteration.</p>
                 <p>From there, a final solution was developed.</p>

           <p>Our final solution centered around relieving the stress felt by family members when a loved one experience POCD. This stress felt by family members can be projected on patients expiericing POCD and worsen the problem - making it an important area to intervene.</p>
            <p>By providing families with an area to momentarily take a break - while still be in view of their loved ones - enables family members to take a quick reprieve and recooperate without feeling that they are leaving their loved one. This design was developed in order to allow family members to take care of themselves guilt-free.</p>
            <p>The physical form for the final iteration was built around the new University of Pennslyvania Medical Center's architectural design and contraints. This design was the final deliervable presented at the hack-a-thon for feedback and reiteration.</p>
